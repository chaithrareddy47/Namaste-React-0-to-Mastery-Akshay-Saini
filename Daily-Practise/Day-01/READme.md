Today's Learnings:

## Basics of React: Components, JSX

I delved into the foundational aspects of React, starting with components - the building blocks of React applications. Understanding how to create and structure components is crucial. Additionally, I grasped the significance of JSX, a syntax extension that allows us to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files. It's a game-changer for creating React UI elements.

## Behind the Scenes: Babel and Its Role

Exploring the workings of Babel gave me insights into how modern JavaScript code, including JSX, gets translated into a format understandable by browsers. Babel's role in transpiling cutting-edge JavaScript features is pivotal for ensuring cross-browser compatibility.

## Understanding Node Modules, Dist Folder, and Cache

Node.js modules are fundamental for organizing code and leveraging external libraries. The `dist` folder, often used to store production-ready code, houses the compiled, minified, and optimized versions of our application. I also learned about cache folders, which store temporary data to enhance performance.

## Parcel, Package.json, and Tooling

Parcel, a web application bundler, simplifies the build process by handling various tasks like transpiling, bundling, and more without configuration overhead. Understanding `package.json` files and their role in managing dependencies, scripts, and project metadata was enlightening. These files are essential for project setup and execution.

By comprehending these concepts, I gained a clearer understanding of how React applications are built, the tools involved, and the underlying mechanisms that power them.
